[version 1.0]
august 2010
NOTE: MAJOR RESTRUCTURING IN THIS RELEASE; DO NOT ATTEMPT TO USE WITH EXISTING APPLICATIONS.

- Object/marker tracking libraries (e.g. FLARToolkit) are now abstracted from FLARManager,
	allowing the use of any tracking library.  This resulted in major structural changes within FLARManager;
	please refer to the updated examples and documentation for more information.

- support for flare/NFT
	
- new FLARMatrixSmoother_Average -- smoothes angle (2x) more than position.
	set via flarConfig or directly.
	old version refactored to FLARMatrixSmoother_AverageSimple.
	
- away3d lite support (done a while back, in SVN)

- abstraction of tracking engine: support for flare/NFT, other engines
	- everything interally uses Matrix3D
	- new flar.camera package simplifies scene setup
	- new flar.tracker package contains classes that communicate with tracking libraries
	
- support for native flash 3d

- bug fix: thresholdAdapter = null

- bug fix: secondary camera validation does not fail when FLARManager does not init

- completed ASDocs

- updated all examples/tutorials to correspond to new restructuring

- made changes for the following FLARToolkit features:
	- thresholdSourceDisplay moved into FLARToolkitManager.
	- minimumLabelSize replaced by labelAreaMin/Max
	- patternToBorderRatioX/Y replaces patternToBorderRatio, allowing for variable pattern-to-border ratios for both width and height
	- FLARMarker.direction re-implemented
	- FLARToolkit.setContinueMode is set to true by default

- ID-markers not yet implemented for FLARToolkitManager.

- FLARManager_AppLauncher and .apps package provide examples using FLARManager for alternative interfaces

- downsampleRatio refactored to trackerToSourceRatio

- flarConfig.xml: camera view defaults to 640x480

- flarConfig.xml: all tracker-related data now lives within <trackerSettings>

- flarConfig.xml: <patterns> element now lives within <flarToolkitSettings>
